Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems.
Enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  Development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C) led to the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
  The advent of structured programming
  The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  -Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   Waterfall - the Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a     
   waterfall while agile is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  - Software Developer - is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer - ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager - oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
    
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
    Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) - Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing 
     code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) while Version Control Systems (VCS) are Software tools for tracking changes to 
      source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).
      
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  Effective communication.
  Agile methodologies. 
  Prioritization of tasks.
  Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
  
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   - Unit Testing - Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing - Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing - Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing - Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
    Process of crafting, refining, and optimizing input queries to effectively interact with artificial intelligence (AI) models, 
    particularly large language models (LLMs)
    Enhances Response Quality - Well-structured prompts help AI models generate precise, coherent, and useful answers\
    Optimizes Efficiency - Properly designed prompts reduce the need for follow-up questions, making interactions with AI more efficient 
    and time-saving.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  Vague Prompt:
      "Tell me about Power Learn Project."

  Improved Prompt:
      "Provide an overview of the Power Learn Project, including its mission, key initiatives, target audience, and impact on digital 
      skills development in Africa."
      
Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective?
    More Specific – Instead of a general request, it directs the AI to focus on mission, initiatives, audience, and impact.
    Clear Scope – It outlines exactly what information is needed, avoiding a vague or overly broad response.
    Relevant and Structured – Ensures the AI provides a detailed, well-organized answer with meaningful insights.
